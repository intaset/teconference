  <p class="body">Manfred Boltze (59) studied Civil Engineering received his doctor degree in 1988 for his work in the area of computerized simulation and optimization of road traffic signal control. After 10 years of working as a consultant, he was appointed as Professor for Transport Planning and Traffic Engineering in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
  <p class="body">He contributed to various working groups to establish German guidelines in the area of transport planning and traffic engineering, e.g. from 1999 to 2007 he chaired the working group “Urban Traffic Control”. He was a member of the Scientific Advisory Board at the German Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (2009-2015). With international projects, memberships in internatio-nal organisations and manifold contacts with foreign universities, Manfred Boltze is an active member of the international traffic and transport science community. From 2009 until 2014 he was the Director of the Vietnamese-German Transport Research Centre at the Vietnamese-German University (VGU) in Hochiminh City, and at the same university he also coordinated the interdisciplinary study program “M.Sc. Traffic and Transport”. He was also the chairman of the Scientific Committee preparing for the World Conference on Transport Research held 2016 in Shanghai.</p>
  <p class="body">His research work focuses on the manifold aspects of traffic management, covering conceptual, technical as well as institutional aspects. Highlights of his research in the recent years have been in the areas of ITS application, traffic signal control, and quality management for traffic and transport systems. Latest research areas also cover environment-responsive traffic control and the impacts of transport on human health.
